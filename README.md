## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the top known languages among the professional developers?
2. How is it going to change the worked language in the future?
3. Which one is the most famous language among the students?
4. Does increase of the known number of languages have positive affect on the Salary?
5. How is the carrier satisfaction by top 10 country participants ?
6. What are the other affects on Career Satisfaction?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook available here to show work related to the above questions.  
Each of question has been showcased by the bulleted number within the notebook.
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@velisari/top-programming-languages-and-future-transformations-aee67040cfc).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
